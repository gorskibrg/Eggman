                      Vince Gironda's method of 36 eggs a day consisted of three 12-egg shakes mixed with half&half dranken throughout the day.
                      However, what he did not know back then was that the bioavailability of protein from raw eggs is <span class="text-strong">significantly</span> less than that of cooked eggs. 
                      According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9772141/">this study</a> the bioavailability of protein from raw eggs is around 50%, compared to over 90% from cooked eggs.

                      I am doing it for only 3 weeks because I honestly don't want to be eating nothing but eggs for my entire life. 
                      3 weeks is long enough to determine if this actually is beneficial. If it is, and I am so inclined in the future to put on
                      <span class="text-strong">even more</span> muscle, then I just might do it again, but for 6-8 weeks.
